      time with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) in between protecting New York<br> from criminals. However, his greatest battle yet 
      is about to begin. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx),<br> Peter must confront an enemy far more powerful than 
      he is. And when his old friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns, Peter comes to realize that all his enemies have
